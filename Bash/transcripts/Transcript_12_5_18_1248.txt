[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mFtp[0m is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user to[m
     transfer files to and from a remote network site.[m
[m
     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.[m
[m
     [1m-4[0m    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.[m
[m
     [1m-6[0m    Use IPv6 only.[m
[m
     [1m-p[0m    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environments where a firewall prevents con‚Äê[m
           nections from the outside world back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support the[m
           PASV command. This is the default if invoked as [1mpftp.[0m[m
[m
     [1m-i[0m    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.[m
[m
     [1m-n[0m    Restrains [1mftp[0m from attempting ‚Äúauto-login‚Äù upon initial connection.  If auto-login is enabled, [1mftp[0m will[m
           check the [4m.netrc[24m (see netrc(5)) file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an account on[m
           the remote machine.  If no entry exists, [1mftp[0m will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is[m
           the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with[m
           which to login.[m
[m
     [1m-e[0m    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled into the [1mftp[0m executable. Otherwise,[m
[7m Manual page ftp(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           does nothing.[m
[m
     [1m-g[0m    Disables file name globbing.[m
[m
     [1m-v[0m    Verbose option forces [1mftp[0m to show all responses from the remote server, as well as report on data[m
           transfer statistics.[m
[m
     [1m-d[0m    Enables debugging.[m
[m
     The client host and an optional port number with which [1mftp[0m is to communicate may be specified on the command[m
     line.  If this is done, [1mftp[0m will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host;[m
     otherwise, [1mftp[0m will enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When [1mftp[0m is awaiting[m
     commands from the user the prompt ‚Äòftp>‚Äô is provided to the user.  The following commands are recognized by[m
     [1mftp[0m:[m

                 and the lists are not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be different from[m
                 expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact result depends on the foreign operating sys‚Äê[m
                 tem and ftp server, and can be previewed by doing ‚Äòmls remote-files -‚Äô Note: [1mmget[0m and [1mmput[0m are[m
                 not meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a[m

                 defined until a [1mclose[0m command is executed.  The macro processor interprets `$' and `\' as special[m
                 characters.  A `$' followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument on[m
                 the macro invocation command line.  A `$' followed by an `i' signals that macro processor that[m

                 "data".  The [4moutpattern[24m determines the resulting mapped filename.  The sequences `$1', `$2',[m

[1mABORTING[0m [1mA[0m [1mFILE[0m [1mTRANSFER[0m[m
     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).  Sending transfers will be immedi‚Äê[m
     ately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote[m
     server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is accomplished depends upon the[m
     remote server's support for ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, an[m
     ‚Äòftp>‚Äô prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the requested file.[m
[m
     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when [1mftp[0m has completed any local processing and is await‚Äê[m
     ing a reply from the remote server.  A long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing described[m
     above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server, including violations of the ftp protocol.  If the[m
     delay results from unexpected remote server behavior, the local [1mftp[0m program must be killed by hand.[m

[1mFILE[0m [1mNAMING[0m [1mCONVENTIONS[0m[m
     Files specified as arguments to [1mftp[0m commands are processed according to the following rules.[m
[m
     1.   If the file name ‚Äò[1m-[0m‚Äô is specified, the [4mstdin[24m (for reading) or [4mstdout[24m (for writing) is used.[m
[m
     2.   If the first character of the file name is ‚Äò|‚Äô, the remainder of the argument is interpreted as a shell[m
          command.  [1mFtp[0m then forks a shell, using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from the[m
          stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argument must be quoted; e.g.  ‚Äú" ls -lt"‚Äù.[m
          A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: ‚Äúdir more‚Äù.[m
[7m Manual page ftp(1) line 385 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file names are expanded according to the[m
          rules used in the csh(1); c.f. the [1mglob[0m command.  If the [1mftp[0m command expects a single local file (.e.g.[m
          [1mput[0m), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" operation is used.[m
[m
     4.   For [1mmget[0m commands and [1mget[0m commands with unspecified local file names, the local filename is the remote[m
          filename, which may be altered by a [1mcase[0m, [1mntrans[0m, or [1mnmap[0m setting.  The resulting filename may then be[m
          altered if [1mrunique[0m is on.[m
[m
     5.   For [1mmput[0m commands and [1mput[0m commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote filename is the local[m
          filename, which may be altered by a [1mntrans[0m or [1mnmap[0m setting.  The resulting filename may then be altered[m
          by the remote server if [1msunique[0m is on.[m

[1mBUGS[0m[m
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the remote server.[m
[m
     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been corrected.[m
     This correction may result in incorrect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii[m
     type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mFtp[0m is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user to[m
     transfer files to and from a remote network site.[m
[m
     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.[m
[m
     [1m-4[0m    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.[m
[m
     [1m-6[0m    Use IPv6 only.[m
[m
     [1m-p[0m    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environments where a firewall prevents con‚Äê[m
           nections from the outside world back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support the[m
           PASV command. This is the default if invoked as [1mpftp.[0m[m
[m
     [1m-i[0m    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.[m
[m
     [1m-n[0m    Restrains [1mftp[0m from attempting ‚Äúauto-login‚Äù upon initial connection.  If auto-login is enabled, [1mftp[0m will[m
           check the [4m.netrc[24m (see netrc(5)) file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an account on[m
           the remote machine.  If no entry exists, [1mftp[0m will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is[m
           the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with[m
           which to login.[m
[m
     [1m-e[0m    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled into the [1mftp[0m executable. Otherwise,[m
